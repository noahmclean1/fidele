# HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAMS (AFTER CREATING **first_download.bat**):
1. put the files that you want to use (e.g. English_entries_with_DUPLICATES_WORD_LIST.docx, English_SERIES_alpha_TEXT.docx) inside the folder named **fidele**
2. open **fidele**
3. click on **run_programs.bat**. this will run the programs for you, and it will ask you the following questions:

`What Word document (in the fidele folder) would you like to run Program 1 on (underline redundant lines and make frequency table)?`

Enter the name of the document making sure to have the .docx extension (e.g. **English_entries_with_DUPLICATES_WORD_LIST.docx**).

This will start running Program 1. 

It will open the new Word document named **redundantLines.docx** with underlined words. To continue with the program, close the Word document. (If you need to find it, it is in the **fidele** folder.)

The program will then open the new Excel file named **frequencyTable.xlsx**. Again, to continue with the program, close the Excel file. (If you need to find it, it is in the **fidele** folder.)

`What Word document (in the fidele folder) would you like to run Program 2 on (identify and sort by reference words)?`

Enter the name of the document making sure to have the .docx extension (e.g. **English_SERIES_alpha_TEXT.docx**).

This will start running Program 2. 

It will open the new Word document named **referenceTable.xlsx**. (If you need to find it, it is in the **fidele** folder.)
